# Bellman Corrected Tree Search (BCTS)

This repository contains an implementation of the Bellman Corrected Tree Search (BCTS) algorithm, as described in the research paper of the same name. The algorithm is a search-based method for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install these packages by running the following command:


### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/bcts.git
cd bcts


### Usage

You can use the `bcts.py` module in your own project or run the example script `example.py` to see the BCTS algorithm in action.
